# RKDG1D1V
Code implementing Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin discretization of model kinetic equations in 1D 1V variables

This coude was written largely in 2008 by Alex Alekseenko with help from Natash Gimelshein. The code is concerned with simulation of flow of non-continuum gas. The code implements gas kinetic equations in the case when molecular collisions are modelled by the BGK collision term. Results computed by this code were reported in
